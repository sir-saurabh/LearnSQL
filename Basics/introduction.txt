To show all the databases:
  show databases;
To create databases:
  create database db_name;
To use database:
  use db_name;
To create table:
  create table student(name varchar(30), id int not null primary key, address varchar(50), marks int);
To describe table:
  desc student;
To insert element into table(secured way):
  insert into student(marks, id, name, address)values(78,12,'sky','patna');
To insert element into table(unsecured way):
  insert into student values('krishna', 32, 'rishikesh', 56);
Multiple value in single query:
  insert into student values ('ram', 45, 'haridwar' 79),('radha', 17, 'delhi', 90);
To select whole table and show the content:
  select * from student;
To select particuler column and show the content:
  select name from student;

  select name, id from student;
To implement some conditions:
  select * from student where id = 32;

Duplicate id will produce error, as it is primary key.

To update value in some column:
  update student set address = 'Deharadun' where id = 45;
To add new column:
  alter table student add phoneNo int;
To update all cells/field in a column:
  update student set phoneNo = 12345
      It will update all cells in the column phoneNo with 12345.
To update single cell/field in a column, add some condition:
  update student set phoneNo = 12345 where id = 12;
To modify existing colum:
  alter table student modify column name varchar(60);
To remove a column:
  alter table student drop column phoneNo;

  To check:
  select * from student;
  or 
  desc student;

To delete particular data of a row.
  delete from student where name = 'kamal';

To find sum, min, max etc aggregate function:

for sum:
  select sum(marks) from student;

for average marks:
  select avg(marks) from student;

To show count of column attribute:
  select count(name) from student;

To find max:
  select max(marks)from student;

To find min:
  select min(marks) from student;

To show data ordered by any column attribute:
  select * from student order by id;
  or
  select * from student order by marks;

To show in descending order:
  select * from student order by id desc;

To select and show name starts with alphabat r:
  select * from student where name like 'r%';

To select and show name contains last word 'h':
  select * from student where name like '%h';

To show name contains second alphabet 'a':
  select * from student where name like '_a%';

To show name contains second last aphabet as '%s_':
  select * from student where name like '%s_';

To join tables we need two or more table, our 1st table is student, create other one:
  create table employee(id int not null primary key, salary int, empcode int, name varchar(30));

To insert values in a table:
  insert into employee values(12,20000, 102, 'aman'), (32,60000, 104, 'arun'), (78, 7000, 105, 'Ram'),(45,30000,202,'kamal');

For inner join:
  select * from student inner join employee on student.id = employee.id;

select * from student;
select * from employee;
  select * from student left join employee on student.id = employee.id;

Right join:
  select * from student right join employee on student.id = employee.id;

Cross join:
  select * from student cross join employee;
